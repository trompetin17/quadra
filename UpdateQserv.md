# Update Your Quadra! #

You probably got here because you saw a message in your Quadra saying that you have an old version. You can do one of two things.

## Best Thing To Do ##

Fairly simple too: upgrade your Quadra!

Just click on the "Downloads" link toward the top of this page, get the Quadra package for your system (you probably do not want the "source", unless you know what you're doing!), and off you go!

It's possible that you might have to clear the "Public game server address" field in the "Options" menu, if you customized this.

Current versions of Quadra have a built-in notification system to let you know in a more friendly way when there is a new version available.

## Easiest Thing To Do ##

If you are have difficulties installing the current version of Quadra, you might be able to work around the problem by
setting the "Public game server address" field in the "Options" menu to "http://qserv.appspot.com/qserv/" (exactly like this, without the quotes).

**Please try the "best thing to do" first!**

### More Details ###

Newer versions of Quadra are able to find the public game server automatically, instead of having to update the option, so that if we have hosting issues, we can move it quickly, and the game keeps working smoothly for you. If you use this "easy" option, you might get a message like the one that brought you here again, or it could not work at all, at any time!
